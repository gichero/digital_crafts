Q: Why doesn't your health go down when an enemy attacks?
H: Your health doesn't change when attacked
P: The zombie attack function does not correctly change values
E: line 15: self.health -= self.power => foe.health -= self.power
A: Correct, the Character attack function was incorrect.  It worked for the hero because the Character attack() was overridden by the Hero attack()
